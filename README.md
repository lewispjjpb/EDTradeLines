# ED TradeLines
Website: http://3.144.245.234:3001/

This website enables users to view dynamically updated commodity prices (synthetic) at thousands of different markets.

It is a website I am regularly updating as a passion project because I love data visualizations.

### üå¥ General Info
ED TradeLines is a visualization tool that allows the user to quickly compare commodity prices in the game Elite Dangerous.  It is constantly updated via a live data feed.  It currently displays buy and sell volumes and price-per-units at a single market, but will have added visualizations and functionality as I continue to optimize and improve upon it.
