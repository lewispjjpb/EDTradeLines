There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.
For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.
If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).
If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.
Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".
Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This website enables the Elite Dangerous community to quickly compare potential profits at a selected station.
## Summary ##
  > This page will display a graph of commodity prices and demand volume, allowing the user to quickly determine the most profitable purchase and sale opportunities at a glance.  The commodity values are updated through a constant stream provided by the Elite Dangerous Data Network (https://eddn.edcd.io/)
  > This page is not affiliated with or endorsed by Frontier Developments.
## Problem ##
  > Station commodity prices are difficult to determine in-game.  While an external data layer broadcasts market prices based on player interaction, determining the best value available to the player for buy and sell options requires third party tools made by other players.
## Solution ##
  > This website displays the information that players want most--highest profit potential--by showing the specific price-per-unit of a commodity at a given market as well as that market's total demand.  The site displays this information using easily digestible line graphs allowing for instantaneous comparison of all options.
